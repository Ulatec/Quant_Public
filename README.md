# Quant
This project will continue to be a significant undertaking. 
Work on this evolving project began in the summer of 2022 
after coming to understand the large number of assets under management at quant trading firms.
It is possible for many mathematical trading strategies to exists that only apply to securities 
with lower liquidity as they are unable to traded by larger quant firms.

The program is primarily focused on back testing strategies that 
consist of specific rate of change moments of correlation between a 
single security and a macroeconomic factor exposure, such as interests, 
currency value, or commodity exposure. 
Basic use of fractal geometry are also used as a secondary method.
